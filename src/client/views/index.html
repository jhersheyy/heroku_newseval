                <h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>
                <article>
                woooo yee haw haw yee namsayin lessgo . when the night is dark, aand the outsides so cold.. *heroes on fireeee*** as a child i knew, boutta world so true. she pulled the down stars. i needed a hero, if i only knew the hero was me. fear pulled me down, reckless and hot. tells me im nothing, when i know that im not.
                <p>
                    Sentiment Analysis uses Natural Language Processing (see below) to find 
                    the overall feeling in a block of text, such as a blog post, tweet,
                    yelp review,etc. Sentiment analysis is also known as opinion mining or
                    emotion AI. A basic example is to determine the overall polarity of a text, 
                    whether it is more positive or negative. While there are various methods to
                    perform sentiment analysis, most of them involve breaking the text to be
                    analyzed into smaller chunks like sentences or phrases. These smaller chunks 
                    are then analyzed and scored consistently, so the overall text is just the 
                    scores of the smaller chunks combined. For example, if a text has 3 phrases, 
                    and 2 are positive, but 1 is negative, then the text will be positive overall.

                    yeet. standing alone in my fire, youre not alooone. 
                    <p>
                        Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of machine learning that 
                        focuses on analyzing human speech, or processing natural language. This 
                        app uses Sentiment Analysis, but that is just one example of NLP.

                    standin aloneee in my fireeee~. youre not alooooooneee.. 
                    <p>
                        Meaningcloud has various API's available for developers to use. 
                        Meaningcloud mainly works on NLP, so blah blah blah blah i d k yo.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the API used for main function for this app, the developers included
                         various measures in the results. The most basic is polarity, but the API
                          also analyzes how ironic the text is, gives it a score, determines if 
                          the sentiments agree overall, and if the text given is objective or 
                          subjective.
